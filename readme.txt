Edits based on user feedback from @joyously 
* Changed from required to recommended plugin for Advanced Custom Fields 
* Added a menu fallback with a button for adding a new menu if no menu is assigned in the top bar
* Corrected sidebar being way too small on pages. 
* Now shows users chosen avatars
* Hide social links if empty


Not taken into account: 
* I was looking at why the footer shows the site title twice, and saw that you are naming classes for styles, such as 'text-muted' and 'text-white'. This is not a good idea in an environment where child themes and users can change styles and colors easily. It is better to name classes using nouns instead of adjectives.
